# Static_Websites_Projects
All of the following websites were created during my Front-end Development course at ReDI School Berlin, during the HTML and CSS semester. Therefore all of those websites are mainly static. 

### Famous Artist Website
This was my first project at my HTML and CSS course. We received a screenshot of a website and had to recreate it.

### Safran Website
This was the second project during my HTML and CSS course. The task was to find a website of a restaurant in Berlin that needed a makeover. My team has chosen the website of a Saftan Restaurant http://www.safran-restaurant.de/home.html. My role in this project was to create the homepage and merge the code and unify the code and style of other subpages.

### Go Vegan Website
This was the final project for the HTML and CSS semester. I worked on this website on my own. This project reflects some of my personal interests that is why, in the future, I would like to develop it and make it a publicly available website.
